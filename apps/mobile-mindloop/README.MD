📘 MindLoop Evaluation & Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Tagline: Learn, retain, and apply the world’s best ideas — faster.

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Problem

People consume vast amounts of educational content — books, podcasts, videos — but forget most of it within weeks (Ebbinghaus curve). Traditional summary apps like Blinkist provide surface-level exposure but fail to help users retain and apply the knowledge.

Solution

MindLoop combines microlearning, gamification, and cognitive science to turn world-class insights into daily, habit-forming learning experiences.
Users don’t just read ideas — they master them through interactive quizzes, recall sessions, and spaced repetition.

⸻

Objective Description Success Metric
Retention-focused learning Make knowledge “stick” using evidence-based methods. ≥70% recall accuracy at 30 days
Engaging experience Gamified progression loops inspired by Duolingo/Candy Crush. D7 retention ≥25%, session length ≥6 min
Personalized growth Adaptive topics and difficulty per learner. ≥60% lesson completion
Freemium revenue model Convert free users to paid subscribers. ≥5% conversion to paid

⸻
