## **2. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **Step 1 — Welcome (5–10s)**

**Copy example:**

> “You read. You listen. But do you
>
> _remember?_

> “Most people forget 80% of what they learn within weeks.”

> CTA →
>
> **“Fix that.”**

🎯 _Purpose:_ Trigger awareness of the forgetting problem.

💡 _Visual:_ A fading text animation of a quote dissolving — showing “forgetting” in real time.

---

### **Step 2 — Knowledge Calibration (15s)**

Show 3 rapid-fire questions from familiar domains:

> “Who wrote
>
> _Thinking, Fast and Slow_

> “What’s the 80/20 rule called?”

> “What does dopamine do?”

Let them answer — no scoring yet.

Then reveal:

> “You remembered 1 of 3. That’s normal. The brain forgets fast — unless you train it.”

🎯 _Psychology:_ Creates _information gap_ and motivation to close it.

---

### **Step 3 — Instant Win Quiz (20s)**

Present a single, fascinating fact — and test it immediately.

> Insight: “Reading a summary gives you exposure, not retention.”

> Quiz: “What improves retention most?”

> Options:
>
> _Re-reading_
>
> _Highlighting_
>
> _Recall practice_

They answer correctly → small celebration.

HUD appears briefly: +XP +Streak 1 +Gems 5

🎯 _Emotion:_ Competence — “This works!”

💡 _Science:_ You’ve already used retrieval practice on them.

---

### **Step 4 — Feedback & Insight (15s)**

Explain the magic.

> “That quick recall you just did? It boosted your memory by 30%.”

> “MindLoop builds this habit for everything you read.”

Animated Ebbinghaus curve shows “Your memory just got stronger.”

🎯 _Outcome:_ Belief — they _see_ the product’s value, not just hear it.

---

### **Step 5 — Value Reveal & CTA (20s)**

Show what they’ll get daily:

- 📚 3 micro-insights
- 🧠 Smart recall training
- 📈 Memory progress tracking

**CTA:**

> “Start your 7-day Memory Challenge”

> Subtext: “3 minutes a day to make knowledge stick.”

✨ Optionally:

“Unlock unlimited insights with **MindLoop+** after your trial.”

🎯 _Conversion lever:_ Aspiration and proof, not pressure.

Would you like me to outline the **UI storyboard** for this — five screens with suggested copy, visuals, and animations — so you can hand it straight to a designer or prototype it in Figma?
