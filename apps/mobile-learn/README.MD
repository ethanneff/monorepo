📘 MindLoop Evaluation & Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Tagline: Learn, retain, and apply the world’s best ideas — faster.

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Problem

People consume vast amounts of educational content — books, podcasts, videos — but forget most of it within weeks. Traditional summary apps like Blinkist provide surface-level exposure but fail to help users retain and apply the knowledge.

Solution

MindLoop combines microlearning, gamification, and cognitive science to turn world-class insights into daily, habit-forming learning experiences.
Users don’t just read ideas — they master them through interactive quizzes, recall sessions, and spaced repetition.
