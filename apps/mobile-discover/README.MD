⏳ Stretch – The App That Makes Time Feel Longer

Tagline: “New experiences, every day. Because newness slows time.”

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Core Insight

Time doesn’t just pass — it’s felt through novelty, attention, and memory.
When every day feels the same, weeks blur together. When we experience something new, life feels longer and richer.

Stretch helps users live more vividly by delivering one daily, personalized challenge that pushes them into new, meaningful experiences.

Concept Description Research Basis
Novelty effect New experiences create denser memory encoding, expanding perceived time. Wittmann & Lehnhoff, 2005; Eagleman, 2009
Memory density theory More unique memories = richer perception of time. BBC Horizon: Do You See What I See?
Reflection Reviewing and labeling experiences cements memory. Neuroscience of reflection & encoding
Gamified habit loops Rewards and streaks sustain engagement. BJ Fogg, Duolingo behavior design

Would you like me to visualize this PRD (flow + loops + value proposition diagram), similar to the MindLoop chart I made earlier?
That would be perfect for pitching or sharing with a designer.
