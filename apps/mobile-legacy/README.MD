👨‍👩‍👧 Legacy – The Story of You

Tagline: Preserve your life stories, values, and wisdom — beautifully.

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Problem

As people age, they accumulate wisdom and life experiences that rarely get documented meaningfully.
Most legacy is financial — not personal.
Families lose the voice, humor, and lessons of loved ones simply because there’s no easy or guided way to capture them.

Solution

Legacy helps older adults (primarily Baby Boomers) easily record, organize, and share their life stories, turning them into a private digital memoir that family can cherish forever.

Through guided prompts, voice recording, and AI-assisted storytelling, the app transforms spoken memories into elegant “Life Books.”

💡 18. Elevator Pitch

“Legacy is a storytelling app for Baby Boomers — it helps them easily record and share their life stories through voice prompts and AI-assisted memoir creation.
Families can listen, comment, and preserve those memories forever.
It’s not just about saving words — it’s about saving who they are.”

⸻

Would you like me to visualize the Legacy app architecture and flow (a clean diagram like the “Stretch” concept) showing user → story capture → AI → family sharing → Life Book output?
That visual would make this pitch investor- and designer-ready.
