⏳ Stretch – The App That Makes Time Feel Longer

Tagline: “New experiences, every day. Because newness slows time.”

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Core Insight

Time doesn’t just pass — it’s felt through novelty, attention, and memory.
When every day feels the same, weeks blur together. When we experience something new, life feels longer and richer.

Stretch helps users live more vividly by delivering one daily, personalized challenge that pushes them into new, meaningful experiences.

Reflection Reviewing and labeling experiences cements memory. Neuroscience of reflection & encoding
Gamified habit loops Rewards and streaks sustain engagement. BJ Fogg, Duolingo behavior design

⸻

🧩 5. Core Product Concept

“A daily challenge that stretches your perception of time.”

• Quick check-in: “Did today feel longer?” (slider or emoji scale)
• Optional short journal or mood tracker 5. Progress & Rewards

💡 20. Elevator Pitch

“Stretch is a daily novelty app that helps you make time feel slower by doing something new every day.
Each morning, you get a small, doable challenge — a moment of curiosity that makes life richer and more memorable.”

⸻

🧮 21. Success Metrics

KPI Target
Waitlist signups pre-launch 2,000+
D7 retention ≥25%

⸻

🚀 22. Long-Term Vision

“Help people live longer — not in years, but in moments remembered.”

Stretch evolves into the first platform for time perception wellness:
• AI “time coach” that measures and improves perceived time richness
• Integration with wearables (mood, steps, novelty score)
• Partnerships with mental wellness programs
• Eventually → “Life in 10,000 New Moments” movement
• push outside comfort zone

Would you like me to visualize this PRD (flow + loops + value proposition diagram), similar to the MindLoop chart I made earlier?
That would be perfect for pitching or sharing with a designer.

# MVP Scope

### **💰 1. The Minimal High-LTV Stack**

You only need **three layers** to generate long-term value sustainably:

| **Layer**                       | **What It Does**                     | **Why It Drives LTV**          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Free Core Loop**              | Keeps acquisition and retention high | Builds habit and trust         |
| **Single Premium Subscription** | Converts habitual users              | Recurring, predictable revenue |
| **Light Microtransactions**     | Adds delight and flexibility         | Spikes ARPU without friction   |

That’s it — no complicated tiering or bundles.

One clean subscription + small optional purchases.

---

### **⚙️ 2. Core Loop (Free Tier)**

Keep the loop fully playable and emotionally rewarding:

1. **Daily Stretch (1/day)**
2. **Reflection (short journal)**
3. **XP + Streak tracking**
4. **Journey Map (basic view)**

These four mechanics are all you need to form habit.

They create the **intrinsic motivation** that later drives upgrade conversion.

---

### **🌅 3. Premium Layer — “Stretch+”**

Instead of multiple plans, just offer **one clean premium upgrade.**

| **Feature**                 | **Why It Matters**                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unlimited Stretches**     | Removes the natural ceiling for your most engaged users (power retention) |
| **Advanced Reflections**    | Unlocks photo/audio journaling — higher emotional attachment              |
| **Weekly & Monthly Quests** | Keeps the mid-term rhythm alive                                           |
| **Journey Map Themes**      | Feeds aesthetic ownership                                                 |
| **Streak Save (1x/week)**   | Protects their investment emotionally                                     |

**💵 Price point:** $5.99/month or $49.99/year

**Optional upsell copy:**

> “Stretch+ helps you live more vividly — with deeper reflections, new challenges, and a map that grows with you.”

---

### **💎 4. Microtransactions (Simple, Ethical, Profitable)**

Two only — both soft and emotionally aligned:

| **Item**             | **Description**                            | **Price**     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Gem Packs**        | Cosmetic unlocks (map themes, aura styles) | $0.99–$4.99   |
| **Streak Insurance** | Protect a missed day                       | $0.99 per use |

Avoid energy refills, XP boosts, or pay-to-skip items — they feel “gamey” and erode the app’s calm integrity.

---

### **🧩 5. Why This Simple Stack Has Strong LTV**

| **Driver**                  | **Mechanism**                   | **Impact**              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Habit retention**         | Daily Stretch + streaks         | Keeps users returning   |
| **Emotional investment**    | Reflection + Journey Map        | Builds attachment       |
| **Subscription attachment** | Premium map + streak protection | Converts long-term      |
| **Occasional delight**      | Gems & cosmetics                | Adds ARPU without bloat |

The key:

Your monetization **mirrors the app’s emotional arc** — curiosity → reflection → identity → belonging.

---

### **🧠 6. Target Metrics (Lean Benchmark)**

| **Metric**                 | **Healthy Range** | **Why**                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Day 7 Retention**        | 35–45%            | Core habit hook working    |
| **Free → Paid Conversion** | 2–5%              | Solid for self-growth apps |
| **ARPU**                   | $2–5/month        | With small gem sales       |
| **LTV**                    | $25–60            | Sustainable for DTC mobile |
| **Payback Period**         | < 3 months        | Ensures scaling margin     |

---

### **🪞 7. The Philosophy of “Less”**

If you try to monetize _time mindfulness_ with too many systems, you’ll feel transactional.

By keeping monetization minimal:

- The user journey stays **sincere**
- Your dev complexity stays **tiny**
- Your long-term retention stays **high**

> The fewer ways people can buy progress, the more valuable progress becomes.

---

### **🏁 TL;DR — Minimal, High-LTV Model**

| **Layer**     | **Components**                         | **LTV Effect** |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Free Loop** | Daily Stretch + Reflection + Streak    | Builds habit   |
| **Premium**   | Unlimited + Quests + Map + Streak Save | Converts depth |
| **Micro**     | Gems + Streak Insurance                | Adds delight   |

---

# MVP - Navigation

> Goal:

> “Do something new → Reflect → Feel progress → Return tomorrow.”

So your MVP only needs:

1. A **Home hub** (core game loop)
2. A **Challenges list** (quest content)
3. A **Profile** (identity + account)

Everything else — social, cosmetics, events — can wait for later stages.

---

## **🧩 1. Top-Level Structure (3 Tabs)**

```
----------------------------------------
| Home | Challenges | Profile |
----------------------------------------
```

### **🏠**

### **Home (Today / Journey)**

**Purpose:** Core daily experience loop

**Contains:**

- **Today’s Stretch** (single challenge card)
- **Reflection modal** (text or emoji log)
- **Progress HUD** (Level · Streak · Gems · Energy — small bar at top)
- **Mini Journey Strip** (visual progress line or 3-dot timeline)

**User Flow:**

1. Open app → See today’s challenge
2. Start → Complete → Reflect
3. Earn XP, gems, and streak
4. Prompt: “Come back tomorrow to stretch again.”

🎯 _Why it matters:_ This _is_ your product. Everything else supports it.

---

### **⚡**

### **Challenges (Quests)**

**Purpose:** Variety + retention engine

**Contains:**

- **Daily Quest (free)**
- **Weekly / Monthly Quests (premium unlock)**
- **Completed log** (shows what you’ve done before)

**User Flow:**

- User scrolls list → chooses quest → completes → reflects.
- Premium users can access deeper quests and earn more XP.

💡 _This tab doubles as your soft monetization surface._

E.g. locked quests show “✨ Unlock with Stretch+”.

---

### **👤**

### **Profile (Identity & Upgrade)**

**Purpose:** Ownership + monetization + retention

**Contains:**

- **Avatar & Level** (visual progression)
- **Streak history**
- **Journey Map (basic)**
- **Subscription section (Stretch+)**
- **Settings & Sign Out**

**User Flow:**

- Check streak progress → see stats → maybe upgrade to Premium for new map themes or reflection tools.

🪙 _All monetization and retention UX live here._

---

## **🧱 2. Persistent Header (HUD)**

At the top of all tabs, include a **compact “time compass” bar:**

```
⏳ Lvl 4   🔥 6d   💎 43   ⚡ 3/5
```

- Tap **Level** → view XP progress
- Tap **Streak** → streak history
- Tap **Gems** → open Gem Vault (earn / buy)
- Tap **Energy** → view recharge timer

🎨 Keep it minimal — subtle animations only.

---

## **🔄 3. Core MVP Flow (User Journey)**

```
Launch App
   ↓
Home → Complete Stretch → Reflect
   ↓
Earn XP + Gems → Level Up (HUD animates)
   ↓
See Journey Progress (mini-map)
   ↓
Return Tomorrow (streak motivation)
```

That’s your **entire MVP loop** — it’s short, meaningful, and habit-forming.

---

## **🚀 4. Secondary Layers (Phase 2+ Add-Ons)**

You can layer these _after MVP traction_ without redesigning navigation:

| **Add Later**             | **Purpose**                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Social Tab**            | Leaderboard, cheers, community          |
| **Shop Modal**            | Cosmetic themes, soundscapes            |
| **Discover Tab**          | New experience packs / local challenges |
| **Journey Map Expansion** | Zoomed-out timeline, milestones         |

By starting simple, you protect focus and reduce dev load.

---

## **🧠 5. Design Principles for MVP Navigation**

| **Principle**                        | **Description**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Every tap = emotional progress.**  | No dead ends — everything connects back to the loop.                |
| **One “Stretch” a day rule.**        | Forces pacing and reflection (and reduces content load).            |
| **HUD always visible.**              | Keeps motivation present.                                           |
| **Profile doubles as upgrade path.** | Monetization without popups.                                        |
| **No extra tabs yet.**               | Avoid social or discovery until DAU > retention threshold (30–40%). |

---

## **🏁 MVP Summary**

| **Layer**      | **Tab**                 | **Core Purpose**                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Home**       | Daily flow              | Complete and reflect on new experiences |
| **Challenges** | Content & pacing        | Explore new quests (some Premium)       |
| **Profile**    | Identity & monetization | See progress, manage account, upgrade   |
| **Header HUD** | Always visible          | XP, streak, gems, energy feedback       |

---

### **TL;DR**

Your MVP navigation should feel like a **Zen RPG HUD:**

> “One screen to act, one to explore, one to reflect.”

That’s all you need for an emotionally sticky, LTV-efficient first version.

---

Would you like me to sketch a **simple wireframe** (just block layout of these three tabs + HUD) to visualize how it all fits together on one mobile screen?

# **🧭 Onboarding Goal**

> “Make users
>
> _feel_

The first-time experience must create _a moment of awe_ — not instruction.

You’re selling **an emotion**, not a utility.

---

## **🌅 1. Flow Overview (5 Steps)**

| **Step** | **Screen**          | **Objective**                      | **Emotion**     |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **1**    | Welcome             | Connect emotionally to the problem | Curiosity       |
| **2**    | Identity Prompt     | Personalize motivation             | Self-reflection |
| **3**    | First Stretch       | Give immediate action              | Engagement      |
| **4**    | Reflection          | Deliver reward + meaning           | Satisfaction    |
| **5**    | Mini Journey Reveal | Show progress & invite upgrade     | Inspiration     |

---

## **🪄 2. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **Step 1 — Welcome (10s)**

**Screen copy:**

> “Ever feel like time is speeding up?”

> “Stretch helps you slow it down — through one new experience a day.”

**CTA:**

➡️ “Stretch My Day”

💡 _Microinteraction:_ Faint ripple animation, as if time is stretching behind the text.

No forms, no clutter, no “create account” yet.

---

### **Step 2 — Identity Prompt (20s)**

Ask a single emotional question to anchor personalization:

> “What kind of moments do you want more of?”

> Options (chips):

- 🌿 Calm
- 💬 Connection
- 🎨 Creativity
- 🌍 Adventure

**Purpose:** Personalizes their first Stretch recommendation.

**Result:** Stores preference for initial content seeding.

🎯 _Psych trigger:_ Autonomy — they’re choosing their path.

---

### **Step 3 — First Stretch (30–45s)**

Immediately give them their first micro challenge — no waiting.

**Example:**

> “Take 30 seconds. Step outside. Notice something you’ve never seen before.”

> Then → “Done” button.

**After pressing Done:**

- Soft confetti pulse
- HUD flashes: +XP, +Gem, +Streak (1)

**Goal:** Deliver the first dopamine moment quickly — “I _did_ something.”

---

### **Step 4 — Reflection (20s)**

Prompt reflection instantly while the moment’s fresh.

> “How did that feel?”

> Slider or emoji reactions (😊 😐 😮 😌).

> Optional short text: “One line to remember this moment.”

Then → “Save Reflection” → XP animation again.

🎯 _Psych trigger:_ Competence & self-expression.

---

### **Step 5 — Mini Journey Reveal (20s)**

Now show _their Journey Map_ for the first time.

A glowing dot appears for “Day 1.”

> “You’ve begun your journey through time.”

> “Each day, a new Stretch. Each day, time feels a little longer.”

Then soft fade-in of CTA:

**[Continue Tomorrow]**

and smaller text link:

**“Unlock more Stretches each day with Stretch+ →”**

🎯 _Why this converts:_ You give the upgrade **context** (“Unlock more Stretches”), not a hard sell. It feels like a natural next step for motivated users.

---

## **💎 3. Key Conversion Mechanics**

| **Element**                     | **Mechanic**                                   | **Reason it Works**                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional hook first**        | “Time is speeding up”                          | Builds narrative resonance instantly                |
| **Immediate value delivery**    | First Stretch within 45s                       | Users _experience_ the product before deciding      |
| **Reflection before sign-up**   | Builds memory + emotional ownership            | Higher retention and perceived value                |
| **Soft paywall after dopamine** | “Unlock more” vs “Upgrade”                     | Leverages curiosity, not guilt                      |
| **No forced signup early**      | Optional “Save Progress” only after reflection | Reduces early drop-off, increases willingness later |
